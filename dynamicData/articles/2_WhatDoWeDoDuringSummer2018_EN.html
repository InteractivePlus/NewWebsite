    <h3>Project 1: New pure-frontend official site</h3>
    <p>First of all, Meteoroid planned the new version of the site, and I finished the project with him. </p>
    <p>The project took us about 1 month to finish. The new official site includes a multi-lang engine. Data in this website are carried by Javascript static files(so that we can just host it on github, and it no longer requires me to update it to the server, which is one of the reasons that motivates me to write this new version). Since we utilized JS dynamic loading, the contents will be loaded after the actual page is loaded, thus efficiently decreases the time needed for loading the website. </p>
    <p>The project sourcecode can be found on Github repository <a href="https://github.com/InteractivePlus/interactiveplus.github.io/" target="_blank">InteractivePlus/interactiveplus.github.io/</a></p>

    <h3>Project 2: User Management System</h3>
    <p>Because the projects in our studio are messed up, and there is no unified user management system(a lot of reason is because everytime I finish writing a new version of OPENAPI, I will stop the server due to user amount issues or code structure issues.), we decided to do a unified user management system for our studio.</p>
    <p>Another reason is that we have long been desired to create a school/business management system, so we started this system(I started this project, and do the majority of the work)</p>
    <p>The backend API had finished testing(Sept. 25), The backend document is more than 2000 words. The system supports Mandarin and English, and is capable of extending horizontally with more than 2 languages. It also includes a plugin support(for backend), a complimentary password recovery, third-party login, third-party auth, user deleting functionality.</p>
    <p>O, Something that we did not finish is the support of OAuth2.0 suggested by Chuange, our solution is to develop a plugin that supports this feature, but it has been pushed for later.</p>

<p>I think that's it.</p>
